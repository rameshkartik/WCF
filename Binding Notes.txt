-Devlpr no need to worry about hw to create architecture
-already foundaton avail
-developr look only problm
-wcf - progmaing framework -abstracts the complexity of creating
services


need to define endpoint? ABC

Address - where service hosted
Binding - how the message sent
Contract- what the message contains

ABC makes endpoint

binding -group of elements contains responsible for
encoding or security.
each element corresponds to transport ,protocol locazted
in channel stack.
chaneel stack - seq of channels tat msg passes thru to 
a run tim arch
wcf - prdefined bindings,
can create custom bindings
-define ABC, all taken care

-multiple endpoints with diffrnt bindings
-same service method could implement diffrnt protocols
and transport options
-quicly expose your serivce to any kind of client that
access it
-.net specific binding- for .net specif clients-benefit
built in security and performance capab
-express service using ws-* standards for java,php or any 
compatible client
-allowss web clients to connect using REST

-logic/contract and business logic all are same,
only the binding config difrs

- explain picture

Address - Where service hosted
location of service
-can be any type of address,ip address,server name etc

http://myserver.com/service
transport scheme,server location, and the path is service

protocols
---------
http - good protocol for communication overweb
tcp - fast binary protocol, good in intranet senarios
named pipe - only for wcf-wcf,fast reliable communication betwen client and server when run on same machine
MSMQ - queuing of messages, useful in disconnected communications between client and server
used -  client wants to enqueue and servrice want to consume later



Behaviour
----------
If yu apply behaviour on diffrnt parts of system 
yu are able to infulence WCF service in regard to things concurrency,session mgmt,throttling,transactions
behviours can be applid at service,endpoint,operation,contract
some configuration inconfig, some in code

Service behaviour
Opeartion behaviour
endpoint behaviour
contract behaviour

Service Behaviour
----------------
service behaviour attribute making behaviours at service level
service metadata httpenabled

Operation behaviour
------------------
-controls the class methods
-things able to do Transactional,caller identity,object recycling
-parameters

Endpoint behaviour
------------------
-used at both the service and the client side
-things such as client credential usage,serializer settings can be managed by applying specific behaviur to the endpoint
-wcf provides predefined set of behaviours which implements IEndpointbehaviour
-credential usage in client and service

Contract behaviour
------------------
-can be modified or extend any aspect of contract
- onlly in code



Various Bindings
----------------
- prefixed with net mean they are designed to take advantage of .net and perform many performance enhance operations
-prfixed with ws- are to be used with all systems and confirm to web standards


BasicHttp binding 
----------------------------------
- two protocols use HTTP as transfer proto
- most interoperable bindings 
-high level of interoperability between WCF and other frmework fr building services
-

WS HttpBinding
--------------
-allows you to use WS-specifications such as WS-SEcurity, WS-Reliable messaging,WS-Atomic Transaction,WS-TRust
- more secure and reliable than basichttpbinding
AZASWSSQSSX

-To communicate with WCF clients use .netTcpbinfing, WCF to WCF communication

WCF Configuration Editor
Binding programatically
-Base address
-Automatic endpoints,default Bindings,Default behaviours
-Setting multiple bindings
-modifying existing bindings

Create Custom Bindings
----------------------
- custom security and  additional transport calls
