SOA
---
-architectural approach in sw development
- application is organized  as services
- services group of methods, share one common requirements
-methods called by client
-published methods in  service are used by client as a black box
-no direct interaction
-work executes as instruct in the input params
- it means service consumers are running in diff machines
-allows business logic to be centralized and other consumers to be decentralized across the neetwork.
SOA structrures messages are sent between machines containing data

-main idea for SOA is to form a loosely coupled system.
-client only knows the signatures describing name,names,types of input parameters, and return type of the function service
- no dependency on technical infrastructure
- interact easily from diffrnt platforms within service
-SOA is a XML language that defines the content
-input parameters ,output are formatedd by soap
- all developments has soap stack,
-not coupled
