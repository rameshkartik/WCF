What is the Service Contract?

-defines functionality which is exposed to the outside world
-functionlity expressed in the form of operations
-as per the operations defined ,soap messages with schemas are exhanged


How do we need to define?

-example code
-class library for an interface and the service contract - useful for versioning,deployment
- To include in the WSDL docu, use [ServiceContract] and [Operation Contract] attribute
- interface without [operation contract], it will not be included in WSDL[opt in model]
-production code should always be separetw wit implementation

How should we implement?

The client
add service reference to obtain the proxy which mimics the funcitoality of a service
